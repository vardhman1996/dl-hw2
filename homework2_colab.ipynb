        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Train on a different text corpus. The corpus should be at least as large as the provided Harry Potter dataset.\n",
        "    - Options include other books, websites, tweets, wikipedia articles etc.\n",
        "    -  (Hint: this is probably the easiest one)\n",
        "2. Train a model using student-forcing.\n",
        "    - You will have to modify the network inputs.\n",
        "    - You will need to use `torch.nn.GRUCell` and its like. https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#grucell\n",
        "    - You cannot simply feed an empty string to start off a sequence. The sequence must be somehow conditioned on prior ground truth.\n",
        "3. Train a model on words instead of characters.\n",
        "    - You will need to redefine your input/output space vocabulary as well.\n",
        "    - You should replace any words that occur less than 5 times in the dataset with an <unknown\\> token. \n",
        "4. Write a new data loader which picks a random point in the text to start from and returns 10 consecutive sequences starting from that point onward. \n",
        "    - You should also modify the train and test functions to reset the memory when you reset the sequence.\n",
        "    - You should consider an epoch to be feeding in approximately the number of characters in the dataset.\n",
        "    - You may run into issues if your dataset size/epochs are not a multiple of your batch size.\n",
        "5. Train on sentences instead of one long sequence.\n",
        "    - You should still produce output character by character.\n",
